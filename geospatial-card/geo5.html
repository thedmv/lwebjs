    <h1>Urban Green Space Analysis: New York City</h1>
    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
    <p>
      This project is about exploring the viability and locations with the best
      potential for placing green spaces that enhance the overall makeup of the
      urban envelope. We use tubes going into space to help the heat balance
      with the core of there earth and the vegetation that is in the middle. The
      goal is to use Full-Column Effervesence to enable the feedback loop
      between organic and non-organic components.
